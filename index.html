    <p class="recipe-para">Biryani and Salan. Bacon and Eggs. Salt and Pepper. Pinot Noir and Caviar. Some things go together, and so do food and streaming videos. A lot of our users associate food with streaming online – consuming their favourite grub while watching something online has become the norm. Even if ‘binge-watching’ is a recent phenomenon, the classic TV Dinner is decades old. And we are constantly trying to find ways to give our users more reasons to love food.</p>

                <p>Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/ Gas Mark 6. Combine the bread mix with 140ml warm water (or according to the pack instructions) and knead into a smooth dough.

    Allow to rest for 5 minutes, then knead again and roll out to a 28cm circle. Place on a lightly greased baking tray and cover with clingfilm. Leave in a warm place for 30-40 minutes.

    Spread the tomato purée over the pizza base and top with the tomatoes. Scatter over the mushrooms and cheese, then make 4 wells in the topping and crack in the eggs. Scatter over the bacon and bake for 20 minutes until crisp and golden.</p>
